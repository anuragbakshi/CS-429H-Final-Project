Proposal:
1. To optimize the fun-to-asm compiler.
2. To add I/O to fun.
3. To add more arithmetic operators to fun.

The optimizations will mainly be removing code without any visible side-effects and possibly simplifying multiple assignment statements into fewer ones.
I/O will consist of adding a way to read numbers from stdin so that the program's output cannot completely be determined at runtime. This will complement the optimization aspect of the project.
The new operators will just be subtraction and division and will serve the make the language more complete and usable.
