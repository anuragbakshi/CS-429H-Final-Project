Please include clear and simple instructions for running your project.
The project can be run using all tests using "make clean test"
(Note: t_scan should be run as "echo '9000\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10' | make t_scan.result" or the input should be typed manually for the test to pass)
The program is called "p4" (most of the base code is from it) and should be run on Linux. Mac OS X will not work as the program does not preserve stack alignment. It has been tested on the lab computers so it should work there.

Explain why your supplied tests illustrate that your project works
The added tests, t_math, t_scan, t_closures, t_concurrency_easy, and t_concurrency test all the language additions to fun.

t_math: tests the new basic arithmetic operators
t_scan: tests the new "scan" keyword to read from stdin in a few cases (in main, in loops, in functions)
t_closures: tests the "bind" keyword in a few situations
t_concurrency_easy: tests basic creation and joining of async tasks
t_concurrency: comprehensively tests async/await and closures in various cases (in main, in functions, in loops, in recursion)
